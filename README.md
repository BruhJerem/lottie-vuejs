lottie-vuejs is a simple VueJS wrapper for [lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web). 

## TL;DR

# Install globally (recommended)
npm install -g lottie-vuejs
```
**OR** use via npx
```bash
# For immediate, no-install usage
npx lottie-vuejs
```
Then...
```bash
# Fill in prompts

# Navigate to library folder
cd path/to/my-component-or-lib

# Do dev stuff using @vue/cli or other live-refresh coding
#  - If single component
vue serve ./src/my-component.vue
#  - If library
vue serve ./src/lib-dev.vue

# Run build process
npm run build

# Ready to publish!
```

### Install

If you just want to try [lottie-vuejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-vuejs), you can run it directly via `npx lottie-vuejs`.

For repeated use, however, you really should install it globally. To do so, simply open a terminal and execute the following:

```bash
npm install -g lottie-vuejs
```

## build
Running the build script results in 3 compiled files in the `dist` directory, one for each of the `main`, `module`, and `unpkg` properties listed in your package.json file. With these files are generated, you're ready to go!
